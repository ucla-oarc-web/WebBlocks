# WebBlocks

## Overview

Out of the box, WebBlocks is a platform based on modern web technologies for 
building full-featured, responsive sites suited for all viewports including 
desktops, tablets and mobile devices. It leverages existing best-in-breed web 
tools, defines semantics based on modern web standards and includes a large 
suite of UI elements and Javascript interactivity libraries. However, WebBlocks 
is a lot more than just a set of semantics, elements and libraries. At it's 
core, it is a highly modular toolkit that can be customized to meet business 
needs, fitted to different development paradigms and integrated into existing 
web solutions.
