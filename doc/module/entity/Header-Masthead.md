# Header/Masthead

## Definition

Masthead the primary page header for a website. It includes an <h1> site title and branding elements. It may optionally include
navigation elements.


## Usages

* Use masthead only for the primary page header for a site
* There should be only one masthead for a page
* Masthead is a special type of header; not every website will have a masthead. In many website/apps a popular pattern is the
  use of a minibar (a nav bar that includes minimal logo) -- this is not a masthead. In this case use nav with an <h1> site title.
* Masthead for News Outlet Sites sites often include details of the publication
* Masthead may include navigation elements such as search and audience or extra-site navigation


## Responsive Considerations

* The branding elements of a masthead will often need to be minimized on smaller screens.
* A collapsible content toggle is often a part of masthead's mobile view (with nav elements hidden in a drawer)
