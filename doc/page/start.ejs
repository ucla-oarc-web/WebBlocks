<h3>What is WebBlocks?</h3>

<p>Out of the box, WebBlocks is a platform for building full-featured, responsive sites with modern web technologies. It leverages existing best-in-breed web tools, defines its semantics based on modern web standards, and includes a large suite of UI elements and Javascript interactivity libraries.</p>

<p>However, WebBlocks is a lot more than just a set of semantics, elements and libraries. At it's core, it is a highly modular toolkit that can be customized to meet business needs, fitted to different development paradigms, and integrated into almost any existing web solution.</p>

<h3>The WebBlocks Strategy</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The modern web is full of powerful technologies. However, they're not necessarily integrated in any reasonable sort of way, and web designers are thus left to fend for themselves. Rather than reinvent, WebBlocks assembles these tools for <strong class="text-primary">a powerful responsive web toolkit straight out of the box</strong>.</li>
    <li>UI frameworks (Bootstrap, HTML 5 Boilerplate, Foundation, etc.) each provide a markup standard. Rather than directly extending one, however, WebBlocks makes it possible to <strong class="text-primary">integrate with any UI framework</strong> through the use of adapters, defining its own semantic markup structure that applies to all.</li>
    <li>WebBlocks <strong class="text-primary">stylesheets are defined with SASS and Compass</strong>. SASS is a precompiler for CSS and Compass is an extremely useful set of SASS utility functions. This makes it very easy to build large-scale CSS in a manageable way.</li>
    <li>WebBlocks is built through a <strong class="text-primary">highly modular and configurable architecture</strong>, meaning that it can be configured to include only exactly what a particular user desires. This reduces the size of the build in the event that not all of its modules and packages are needed.</li>
    <li>WebBlocks is built using Ruby and Node.js packages. However, as it produces static web assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.), it can be deployed in any environment, making it truly <strong class="text-primary">platform independent for deployment</strong>.</li>
    <li>WebBlocks looks at <strong class="text-primary">federation as first-class citizens</strong>. An organization can fork WebBlocks, add its own extensions and then redistribute it to units and other organizations that may do the same or deploy it as is.</li>
    <li>WebBlocks is highly configurable, making it possible to <strong class="text-primary">integrate it into any existing build cycle</strong>.</li>
</ol>
