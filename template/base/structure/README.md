# Base/Structure

## Definition

This library provides utility classes for defining the basic structure of the document.

## Usages

* Define a max width container

## Features

The `.container` class can be added to create a container with a fixed max width.

## Responsive Considerations

While the `.container` provides a fixed max width, the container will scale to the max
width of the viewport for any viewport widths smaller than this fixed max width.
