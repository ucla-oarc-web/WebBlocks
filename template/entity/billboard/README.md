# Billboard

## Definition

A Billboard is a narrative device (primarily used by marketing websites) to convey a story about a website using the following pattern: a compelling media feature (image/slideshow/video, a supporting tagline and a call-to-action button. As a narrative device, the billboard functions to capture a users' attention/curiosity and lead the user towards a "conversion path" for further information. 

## Usages

* Use to feature primary narrative content for a page. 
* There is only one billboard per page; Using multiple billboards will lessen its effect/impact.

## Features
* A billboard may be executed with either a div or a figure; if using a figure, the semantic suggestion is that the content can be considered an encapsulated unit where the flow within the page can be arbitrary to the surrounding content.
* If using figure, the tagline should be marked up as a fig caption; html5 stipulates that only one fig caption may be nested in a figure while multiple images can be.
* If each image requires its own caption, use the nested figure alternative markup.
* A call-to-action button is supported but optional to the billboard. 
* Interactive media features are optionally supported (js slideshow/ js carousel/ js accordion / video player); in such a case player controls will need to be rendered.


## Responsive Considerations

* Image resizing will be an issue. 
* Player controls for interactive type billboards should be thoughtfully positioned in relation to mobile constraints and UI standards on transformation.
